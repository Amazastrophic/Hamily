# Hamily 3D Assets (Work in progress)
CC0 assets full of hams aka [sail-o-bots](https://opensea.io/collection/sail-o-bots-by-undefined). Current goal is to make all ham pieces and hams in 3D for downloading into the metaverse. We use the GLB format as it's quickly becoming the 3D standard for the metaverse. Eventaully we hope to make a generator that spits out all the hams based on NFT data. 

## [Preview Site](https://storageapi.fleek.co/94da0b0e-3d2c-46dc-a94c-df68eb5eec1b-bucket/Hamily/hams.html)
Just a simple page showing 3 hams with some general info.

## Feedback
Materials can be set to very metallic and look pretty cool but right now they are more of a classic plastic. Animations are rough 

## Contributions
Just open a PR for whatever. We are open to others helping for sure.

If you want to help out [Amazastrophic](https://sagetowers.com), the two hamless fools making these pieces into 3D thanks to CC0; we like the hams and eth: 0xA6Ee0f0c7bB5ab94A666bc78455060EF4Daa44bB


## IPFS Links to GLB downloads
Until we get more and someone wants to manage it better just tossing links below. Don't think it would take much to set up an API for downloads into the metaverse, maybe one day. But they are CC0 so no fear you get burned for including them instead of downloading them.
