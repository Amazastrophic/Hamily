# Hamily 3D Assets (Work in progress)
CC0 assets full of hams aka [sail-o-bots](https://opensea.io/collection/sail-o-bots-by-undefined). Current goal is to make all ham pieces and hams in 3D for downloading into the metaverse. We use the GLB format as it's quickly becoming the 3D standard for the metaverse. Then 

## [Preview Site](https://storageapi.fleek.co/94da0b0e-3d2c-46dc-a94c-df68eb5eec1b-bucket/Hamily/hams.html)
Just a simple page showing 3 hams with some general info.

## Feedback
There is a slight difference in sail-o-bot #53 and #559 materials. #53 has metallic and smoothness turned up (0.7 out of 1) to give it a more metal feel. Unsure how the community views themselves in 3D.

## Contributions
Just open a PR for whatever. We are open to others helping for sure.

## IPFS Links to GLB downloads
Until we get more and someone wants to manage it better just tossing links below. Don't think it would take much to set up an API for downloads into the metaverse, maybe one day. But they are CC0 so no fear you get burned for including them instead of downloading them.
